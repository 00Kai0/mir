This directory contains some usefull utility:

* `m2b` taking MIR textual from from stdin and outputing the
  corresponding MIR binary form to stdout

* `b2m` taking MIR binary from stdin and outputing the corresponding MIR
  textual form to stdout

* `b2ctab` taking MIR binary from stdin and outputing C code
  containing an array initialize by the MIR binary

  * You can generate a standalone program executing the MIR binary by
    `cc -O2 -fno-tree-sra mir.c mir-gen.c mir-binary-driver.c -ldl`

  * The program reads MIR binary from the array and execute it by
    interpreter (if you add `-DMIR_USE_INTERP` to the above
    compilation command) or code generated by MIR generator (by
    default)

  * The C array code file name can be given with the command line
    option `-DCTAB_INCLUDE_STRING=<file name as string>`.  The default
    name is `"mir-ctab"`
